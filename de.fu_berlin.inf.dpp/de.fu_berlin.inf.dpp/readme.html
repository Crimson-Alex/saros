<h2>Limitations</h2>

The following limitations need to be considered as of version 0.6.1

<ul>
	<li>Sessions can only have one participant (besides the host).</li>
	<li>Sometimes files are transmitted with wrong line delimiters, which results in 
	different checksums for files when checking them for identicalness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connecting to a server</h2>

You need a Jabber account to use Saros. You can create a new account from Saros 
if you don't already have one.

<h3>Creating a new account</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Open the Roster View (Select it from Window &gt; Show View &gt; 
	Other... &gt; Roster)</li>
	<li>Click on the second button on the Roster toolbar</li>
	<li>Fill the fields (you can use jabber.org as a Jabber server)</li>
	<li>Check the 'Store the new configuration in your preferences'</li>
	<li>Select 'Finish'</li>
</ol>

<h3>Using an existing account</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Open the preferences window (Window &gt; Preferences...).</li>
	<li>Select the 'Saros' category.</li>
	<li>Enter your account data.</li>
</ol>

To connect select the Roster View (Menu &gt; Window &gt; Show View &gt; 
Other... &gt; Roster). Click on the connect button (1st button in the local 
toolbar). The button will always show you, your current connection status. You 
also see the status line of the Roster View for more detailed information.

preferences, you will also find the option to automatically connect on startup.

the roster viewer.

<h2>Beginning a shared project sessions</h2>

<h3>Hosting a shared project session</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Right-Click on a project in your resource navigator (or package navigator) 
	and select 'Share project...' from the context menu.</li>
	<li>Now you see the 'Shared Project Session' viewer and yourself as 
	only participant.</li>
	<li>To invite other users, select the 'Roster' viewer again.</li>
	<li>Right-click on a user and select 'Invite user to shared project...'</li>
</ol>

<h3>Joining a running shared project session</h3>

To join a running shared project session you need to be invited by a 
participant of that session (see above).

<ol>
	<li>If you're invited a wizard dialog will appear on your screen, stating 
	who the inviter is and an additional short description. Select 'Next' if you 
	want to accept the invitation.</li>
	<li>Before being able to work on the shared project it needs to be fully 
	replicated to your system. 	You can accelerate this process by providing a local 
	project which will be used as base for the synchronization between your 
	system and the remotely shared project. Select the project from the list 
	which has the highest value in parentheses. The value states the identicalness 
	of the local project and the remotely shared project. The higher the number, 
	the less synchronization will be needed before starting the session.</li>
	<li>Select wether you would like to overwrite your local project or to create
	a new project. Practically this will create a new project, which contains all 
	files of your chosen base project.</li>
	<li>Select 'Finish'.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using a shared project session</h2>

Only the driver is allowed to edit the resources in the shared project. 
There can only be one driver at any time. When starting a shared project 
session the host is automatically the driver.

When the driver opens a file, a small green dot will decorate the resource in the 
navigator. This mark always shows the latest resource that the driver is using 
or has used. 

<h3>Replicated actions</h3>

The following types of actions are currently supported and replicated in real time..

<ul>
	<li>Text changes</li>
	<li>Cursor positions and selections</li>
	<li>File additions/removals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing the user role</h3>

There are two ways to change the owner of the driver role.

<ul>
	<li>If you're the current driver or host of the session, you can give the 
	driver role to another user. To do this select a user in the 'Shared 
	Project Session' viewer and select 'Give driver role' from the context 
	menu.</li>
	<li>If you're the host of the session, you can take back the driver role 
	at every moment. Select the 'Take driver role' button from the session 
	viewer.</li>
</ul>
